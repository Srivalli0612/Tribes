        <h2>About Our Website</h2>
        <body>
        The main motto of our website is to expose the culture of the tribe and the problems they are facing. The technology has increased a lot, but still many tribes are lagging behind. By exposing their lifestyle, netizens of India come to know more about them and can help them.
         When the common people from our country visit them, it becomes a tourist spot, and there are a lot of chances that it may become a source of income for the tribes. 

        Apart from creating a website, we directly contact the tribes according to our convenience and note down the changes before and after creating the website.

         By developing these ideas, we feel there is a lot of scope for development in their lives and protecting the heritage of ourÂ country.<!-- Add content about your organization -->
